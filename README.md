    Motivation
</h3>

**Why was this created?**  In the open source development community, there isn't a single React Native gallery that can efficiently render a very large list of images with the initial index being placed anywhere in the list of images while supporting both Android and iOS. This gallery solves all that along with gestures and important event listeners for pan, pinch, single tap and double tap.
